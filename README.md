[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app/releases).


Module usage examples:

- [without authentication](examples/without_authentication) - complete example without authentication
- [with Google OIDC authentication](examples/with_google_oidc_authentication) - complete example with Google OIDC authentication
- [with Cognito authentication](examples/with_cognito_authentication) - complete example with Cognito authentication
