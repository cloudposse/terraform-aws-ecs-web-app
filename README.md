## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ecs-web-app/releases).


For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which test and deploy the example on AWS), see [test](test).

Other examples:

- [without authentication](examples/without_authentication) - without authentication
- [with Google OIDC authentication](examples/with_google_oidc_authentication) - with Google OIDC authentication
- [with Cognito authentication](examples/with_cognito_authentication) - with Cognito authentication
